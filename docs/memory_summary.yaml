    A user request was made to remove the counter feature from the app and introduce a new onboarding flow for a luxury chauffeur service app called Gyde. The onboarding flow should consist of multiple pages with sliding transitions, each containing specific phrases. The pages include a welcome page, authentication options page, phone number input page, verification code page, email collection page, welcome confirmation page, and terms and conditions page. Each page should have a 'Next' or 'Continue' button and use 'Gyde' branding throughout.
