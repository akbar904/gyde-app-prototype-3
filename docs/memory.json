Removals: \n   - The HomeView and StartupView, along with their corresponding ViewModel files, have been removed from the application. \n   - Several methods such as 'incrementCounter', 'showDialog', 'showBottomSheet', and 'runStartupLogic' have been removed. \n   - Some dependencies like 'gap.dart' and 'stacked_services.dart' have been removed from certain files.\n\n3. Changes: \n   - The architecture overview now mentions the onboarding flow and its sliding transitions between pages. \n   - The navigation flow has been updated to start with the WelcomeView and progress through the onboarding pages. \n   - The project description now mentions the onboarding flow for the Gyde service. \n   - The sequence diagram has been updated to reflect the new navigation flow. \n   - The state management flow now refers to the OnboardingViewModel for handling business logic and state. \n\nThese changes significantly affect the app's structure and functionality, shifting the focus from the home and startup views to a comprehensive onboarding flow."
