### Verification

1. **Method Signatures**: The `AuthOptionsView` class does not contain any methods. It only uses a builder function within the `ViewModelBuilder` to construct the UI and handle actions. There's no mismatch with method signatures as none are explicitly defined in the public interface document for this file.

2. **Widget Properties**: The widget properties used (`Text`, `ElevatedButton`, etc.) are standard Flutter widgets and are used correctly. The text within the `Text` widgets matches the specified phrases from the change request.

3. **External Methods and Widgets**: The `ViewModelBuilder` and ViewModel (`AuthOptionsViewModel`) are assumed to follow the Stacked architecture, which is consistent with the project's architecture description. There is no provided public interface document to verify specific method signatures for these, but their usage aligns with typical Stacked patterns.

4. **Corrections and Explanation**: No corrections were needed. The implementation followed the high-level plan and change request accurately, ensuring the onboarding flow for the luxury chauffeur service app is correctly represented.
