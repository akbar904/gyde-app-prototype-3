### Verification Steps:

1. **Method Signature Verification:**
   - The `WelcomeView` class is implemented as a `StatelessWidget`, which is consistent with the typical Flutter widget implementation.
   - The `build` method signature matches the expected signature for a Flutter widget's build method.
   - The `WelcomeViewModel` contains a method `navigateToAuthOptions` which is used to navigate to the next page, aligning with the required onboarding flow.

2. **Widget Properties Verification:**
   - All widget properties such as `Text`, `ElevatedButton`, and `Padding` are defined in accordance with Flutter's standard widget properties.
   - The text and descriptions in the widgets match exactly with the phrases specified in the Change Request.

3. **Consistency with Other Files:**
   - The `NavigationService` and `Routes.authOptionsView` are presumed to be defined in the `app.router.dart` file, maintaining consistency with the application's architecture for routing.

4. **Inconsistencies Correction:**
   - No inconsistencies were found between the provided interface document and the generated code. All specifications and change requests have been adhered to in the implementation.
